## I. Domain (Business Logic)

We classify business logic as any domain-specific logic that: is neither UI nor Android stuff nor IO (persistence or network calls).

Now knowing what the `domain` isn't, lets define what it is

# _WIP...._

### 1. Functional Programming (pure)

### 2. Actions (use-cases)

### 3. ViewModel

## II. UI

### `:ivy-design`

## III. Data model

## IV. IO (network + persistence)
